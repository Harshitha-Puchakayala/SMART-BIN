# SMART-BIN
The Smart Bin is an automated dustbin that opens its lid when trash is detected. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of an object near the bin and a servo motor to control the opening and closing of the lid. This project aims to promote hygiene and reduce the spread of germs by minimizing the need for physical contact with the bin.
